# MECH105_Algorithms

The folder you have contains a collection of algorithms that you wrote during your time as a student. Each algorithm is a set of instructions designed to solve a particular problem or perform a specific task.

Inside the folder, you will find various files containing code written in different programming languages, such as Java, Python, C++, or others. Each file represents a different algorithm, with a unique name that describes its purpose.

Some of the algorithms may be simple and straightforward, while others may be more complex and require a deeper understanding of programming concepts. Regardless of their complexity, each algorithm is a testament to your learning and growth as a student, as well as your ability to solve problems using code.
